A GraphQL-like language. Preliminary experiments.

## Current state

I am writing in Coq the formal semantics I was working on [here](https://github.com/mstn/graphql).

This project is nothing more than an exercise to learn Coq by doing.

I am following the Software Foundations book very closely. The overall approach and the programming style are borrowed from there.
